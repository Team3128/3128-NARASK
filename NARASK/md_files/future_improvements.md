## Preamble: 
In a year, it is inevitable that there are improvements that the department cannot reach in time. 
This place functions as a documentary and history of ideas we hope to pursue in the future.

### 2024-2025 School Year
- Minibot docu
- NARDash docu
- submodules must be removed before making a push to a branch (people trying to access thatbranch with a submod pushed will deny them access), meaning that these should be for development purpose, we must still rely on releases. implement a .gitignore to account for this
- Yearly Integration docu
- Practicals -> common errors and how to account
- if you run into an indexing error when trying to shift branches, attempt running "git submodule update (--remote)"

### IDEAS FOR CONTROL INNOVATION
